# Waves dApps
 
### Ride language

Waves blockchain uses functional programming language based on expressions called RIDE. It is simple, yet efficient. 
Please check [ride documentation](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/ride)


### Writing dApps

A dApp, or decentralised application, is an application, that executes in a distributed computer system, for instance, 
in a blockchain. In particular, Waves dApp is an application, written in RIDE language and executed on the nodes of the 
Waves blockchain. Check [writing dApps](https://docs.wavesplatform.com/en/building-apps/smart-contracts/writing-dapps)
section

### Examples

IDE contains a lot of runnable Scripts, dApps and tests to help you get used to Ride language.
Check them in Library menu
